**PDF Tools Web Application**
This repository houses a sophisticated web application built using Flask, a lightweight WSGI web framework. The application is designed to provide users with a suite of tools to manage and manipulate PDF files with ease. The tools include functionalities for converting PDF documents to editable Word files, splitting PDFs into multiple sections, and merging several PDFs into a single document.

**Key Features:**

**PDF to Word Conversion:** 
Transform your static PDF documents into editable Word files, preserving the original formatting.

**PDF Splitting:** Divide large PDF files into smaller, more manageable sections, specifying the range of pages to include in each output file.

**PDF Merging:** Combine multiple PDF documents into a single file, streamlining the process of consolidating information.

This application is built to be user-friendly and responsive, ensuring a seamless experience across different devices. 

It leverages modern web technologies, including Bootstrap for design and responsiveness, and PyPDF2 and pdf2docx libraries for robust PDF processing capabilities.

The project is containerised using Docker, allowing for easy deployment and scalability. The repository also includes a docker-compose configuration to facilitate a smooth setup process.
